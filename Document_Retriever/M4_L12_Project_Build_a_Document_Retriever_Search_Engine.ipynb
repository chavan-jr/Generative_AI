It is the second largest city in India after Mumbai. It is on the east bank of the River Hooghly. When it is called Calcutta, it includes the suburbs. This makes it the third largest city of India. This also makes it the world's 8th largest metropolitan area as defined by the United Nations. Kolkata served as the capital of India during the British Raj until 1911. Kolkata was once the center of industry and education. However, it has witnessed political violence and economic problems since 1954. Since 2000, Kolkata has grown due to economic growth. Like other metropolitan cities in India, Kolkata struggles with poverty, pollution and traffic congestion. The discovery of the nearby Chandraketugarh, an archaeological site has proved that people have lived there for over two millennia. The history of Kolkata begins when the English East India Company arrived in 1690. Job Charnock, an administrator with the Company is traditionally known as the founder of this city. However some academics say that Charnock is not the city's founder. At that time Kolkata, ruled by the Nawab of Bengal Siraj-Ud-Daulah, had three villages. They were Kalikata, Govindapur and Sutanuti. The British in the late 17th century wanted to build a fort near Govindapur. This was to become more powerful than Dutch, the Portuguese, and the French. In 1702, the British completed the construction of old Fort William, which was used to station its troops and as a regional base. Calcutta was declared a Presidency City, and later became the headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. When regular fights with French forces started, in 1756 the British began to upgrade their fortifications.

However, the capital shifted to the hilly town of Shimla during the summer months every year, starting from the year 1864. Richard Wellesley, the Governor General between 1797–1805, helped in the growth of the city and its public architecture. This led to the description of Calcutta as \"The City of Palaces\".

Sounds (phones) that carry meaning in language are called phonemes. Sounds that do not carry meaning in the language are called allophones. Phonology focuses on the study of phonemes, \"units of sound (speech) that distinguish one word from another in a particular language.\" Phonology also includes studies of how words are , or spoken. Phonology refers to the sound patterns of a language. Phonology is different from phonetics. Phonology studies how sounds form meaning in language. Phonetics studies how those sounds are formed. Studies of phonology and phonetics are sometimes combined, which results in more specific areas of study.')]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":79}],"source":["query = \"what is the study of language?\"\n","docs = final_retriever.invoke(query)\n","docs"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":80,"metadata":{"id":"ONMSpCItZovi","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736616971918,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2867,"user":{"displayName":"satish chavan","userId":"03125428900663581798"}},"outputId":"85d0552d-2120-4519-c2c0-f40693a1807f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[Document(id='c5c5bf4b-4ba6-4354-85ef-f427a97723a0', metadata={'article_id': '234589', 'title': 'History of chess'}, page_content='The history of chess goes back 2200 years. It was played in Chinese Warring Sates Period about 200BC, called XiangQi. Modern International Chess game though originated in northern India in the 6th century (which shares quite a few common Characteristics with the Chinese creation) and spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently, through the Moorish conquest of Spain, spread to Southern Europe. But in early Russia, the game came directly from the Khanates (muslim territories) to the south. In Europe, the moves of the pieces changed in the 15th century. The modern game starts with these changes. In the second half of the 19th century, modern tournament play began. Chess clocks were first used in 1883, and the first world chess championship was held in 1886. The 20th century saw advances in chess theory, and the establishment of the World Chess Federation (FIDE). Chess engines (programs that play chess), and chess data bases became important. The precursors of chess originated in northern India during the Gupta empire, where its early form in the 6th century was known as Chaturanga.

According to ChessVariants.com, \"Perhaps the enduring popularity of Shogi can be attributed to its \\'drop rule\\'; it was the first chess variant wherein captured pieces could be returned to the board to be used as one\\'s own.
